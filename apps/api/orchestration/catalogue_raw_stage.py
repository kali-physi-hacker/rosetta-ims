"""Raw stage: preserve, validate, identify and audit the original supplier file.

The raw stage answers exactly one question: what did the supplier send us,
and is the stored original intact? It verifies the durably stored original
(existence, readability, size limit, path safety, signature, checksum),
performs lightweight structural inspection only (PDF encryption flag and page
count — never text extraction), records the outcome, and returns a typed
result that carries identifiers and file facts but no file content.

State model (documented and tested):

- ``CatalogueRawStageAttempt`` is the append-only history — one immutable row
  per raw-stage execution, completed or failed. Re-running raw appends a new
  attempt; earlier attempts are never overwritten, so a later integrity
  failure can never erase the record of an earlier successful verification.
- The mutable fields on ``CatalogueSourceDocument`` (``raw_stage_status``,
  ``raw_stage_completed_at``, ``byte_size``, ``page_count``) mirror the MOST
  RECENT attempt only, for cheap status queries — ALL of them, so state can
  never read ambiguously: a failed latest attempt clears the completion
  timestamp and carries only what that attempt actually observed. The
  earlier successful verification stays in the attempt history.

This module must never import or reach an AI provider, OCR, document parsing,
extraction, interpretation, normalization or business validation. Anything
that tries to understand what the file MEANS belongs to the extraction stage
and later stages, which consume the stored original through its durable
``source_ref`` after this stage has completed. Terminology note: the
``CatalogueRawObservation`` model is NOT this stage's output — it holds
extracted evidence observations produced by the extraction stage.
