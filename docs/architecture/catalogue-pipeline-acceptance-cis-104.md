# CIS-104 End-to-End Acceptance Evidence

Status: acceptance proof added  
Date: 2026-07-23

This note records the current end-to-end acceptance proof for EPIC CIS-03 and
story CIS-104. It is deliberately narrower than a product demo: it proves the
implemented backend boundaries compose correctly without adding UI, automatic
approval, automatic publication, or new supplier semantics.

Current implementation evidence:

| Boundary | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Supplier and pipeline contracts | `apps/api/schemas/catalogue_pipeline/` |
| Supplier contract runtime selection | `apps/api/services/supplier_source_contract_runtime.py` |
| Durable source submission | `apps/api/services/catalogue_submission.py`, `apps/api/routers/v2/catalogues.py` |
| Pipeline persistence | `apps/api/v2/models/catalogue_pipeline.py`, `apps/api/services/catalogue_pipeline_persistence.py` |
| Stage services | `apps/api/services/catalogue_pipeline_stages.py` |
| Prefect orchestration | `apps/api/orchestration/catalogue_flows.py`, `apps/api/orchestration/catalogue_tasks.py` |
| Serving publication contract reconstruction | `serving_item_to_contract` in `apps/api/services/catalogue_pipeline_persistence.py` |

## Vertical Slice

`apps/api/tests/test_catalogue_pipeline_e2e_acceptance.py` drives the smallest
representative slice:

```text
v2 authenticated submission
-> durable source file and queued run
-> Prefect orchestration
-> Raw Observations
-> Staging Items
-> Validation Issue for invalid row
-> pending-review Mastering Candidate for valid row
-> explicit test-reviewer approval
-> approved Supplier Offer, packaging and supplier price
-> Serving publication
-> ServingItemV1 reconstruction
-> lineage assertions back to Raw, source document and run
```

The test substitutes only the nondeterministic extraction provider output. From
the extraction adapter onward it uses real contracts, persistence, stage
services, orchestration, review, application and publication services.

The fixture contains:

| Row | Path | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Hill's `10447`, `Hill's Healthy Cuisine Chicken 82g`, HKD `13.10`, `82g` | Valid | Reaches pending-review candidate, explicit approval, supplier commercial state and Serving publication. |
| Hill's `Q-1`, `Quoted Special Order Item`, `By Quote` cost | Invalid | Creates blocking `STAGING_COST_BASIS_UNRESOLVED`; no Mastering Candidate, approval, commercial state or Serving publication. |

## Requirement Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Implementation evidence | Test/runtime evidence | Gap/action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authenticated catalogue upload creates an Ingestion Run. | PASS | `CatalogueSubmissionService.submit`, `/v2/catalogues/ingestions` | Acceptance test asserts `202`, one `CatalogueImport`, one `CatalogueSourceDocument`, one queued `IngestionRun`. | None. |
| Original source document is referenced. | PASS | `CatalogueSourceDocument`, source checksum/source ref, `IngestionRun.catalogue_source_document_id` | Acceptance test asserts persisted source, checksum, stored file and run/source contract agreement. | None. |
| Pipeline execution does not occur inline in submission. | PASS | Submission service has no Prefect/stage calls. | Acceptance test patches extraction/tagging to fail during POST and asserts no Raw/Staging/Candidate rows after submission. | None. |
| Submission idempotency and conflict behavior are verified. | PASS | `CatalogueSubmissionIdempotency` | Acceptance test replays same key/material and receives same run; changed material gets `409 IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. | None. |
| Raw extraction output is persisted. | PASS | `CatalogueRawObservation`, `RawObservationService.capture` | Acceptance test asserts two Raw Observations and reconstructs `RawObservationV1`. | None. |
| Raw data is not mutated during normalization/review/publication. | PASS | Raw and staging models are separate; raw rows have no review fields. | Acceptance test stores raw text before review and asserts unchanged after approval/publication. | None. |
| Staging records are generated separately from Raw. | PASS | `CatalogueStagingItem`, `CatalogueStagingRawObservation` | Acceptance test asserts two Staging Items and raw-observation links. | None. |
| Staging records validate against the staging contract. | PASS | `staging_item_to_contract` reconstructs `StagingCatalogueItemV1`. | Acceptance test reconstructs staging contracts for valid and invalid rows. | None. |
| Validation occurs before mastering and cannot be bypassed. | PASS | `CatalogueValidationService.evaluate_staging`, `MasteringService.prepare_candidate` blocker checks. | Acceptance test asserts validation issue is created before invalid candidate preparation is rejected. | None. |
| Invalid records do not silently enter canonical/load persistence. | PASS | Blocking issue guard in mastering, approval/application, publication services. | Acceptance test asserts invalid row has no candidate and is absent from Serving. | None. |
| Invalid/ambiguous records produce Validation Issues or DLQ-equivalent rows. | PASS | `CatalogueValidationIssue` durable model. | Acceptance test asserts `STAGING_COST_BASIS_UNRESOLVED`, raw value, guidance, source/run lineage and publish-blocking flag. | None. |
| Valid records reach Mastering Candidates. | PASS | `MasteringService.prepare_candidate` | Acceptance test asserts one candidate in `PENDING_REVIEW`. | None. |
| Orchestration stops truthfully at human review. | PASS | Prefect flow stops after candidate preparation. | Acceptance test asserts no ReviewDecision, SupplierProduct or Serving row before explicit approval/application/publication. | None. |
| Approval is explicit, attributable and auditable. | PASS | `ReviewDecisionService.record_decision`, `CatalogueReviewDecision` | Acceptance test supplies `acceptance-reviewer@example.com`, reason, expected candidate revision and checks idempotent replay. | None. |
| Stale/concurrent review is rejected. | PASS | Stale candidate timestamp guard. | Acceptance test asserts `StaleCandidateRevision` for an old candidate timestamp. | None. |
| Valid records load into canonical or approved supplier-commercial representation. | PASS | `ApprovedCommercialStateService.apply_approved_candidate`, `CatalogueSupplierProduct`, `CatalogueSupplierPrice`, `CataloguePackagingConfiguration` | Acceptance test asserts Supplier Offer, canonical product link, HKD price, price basis and content measure. | Existing canonical `Product` must already exist; automatic Product Variant creation remains a later matching/mastering task. |
| Loaded records retain ingestion lineage. | PASS | Price, packaging, candidate and serving lineage columns. | Acceptance test asserts supplier price has `ingestion_run_uuid` and publication lineage points to candidate/staging/raw. | None. |
| Canonical records are retrievable through the serving layer. | PASS | `CatalogueServingPublication`, `serving_item_to_contract` | Acceptance test reconstructs `ServingItemV1` from current publication. | No public v2 serving HTTP endpoint is required by this acceptance proof. |
| Serving contains only approved data. | PASS | `ServingPublicationService.publish`, `ServingItemV1` review-status guard. | Acceptance test asserts publish before approval fails and invalid/pending rows are absent from serving lineage. | None. |
| Serving publication is explicit and idempotent. | PASS | `PublishServingItemCommand` stable publication key. | Acceptance test publishes after approval/application and replay reuses the same publication. | None. |
| Served fields are traceable to ingestion run/source. | PASS | `ServingItemV1.lineage`, raw/staging/candidate/source/run tables. | Acceptance test machine-asserts SKU, supplier SKU, name, cost, currency and packaging content lineage to staging, raw, page location, source document and run. | None. |
| Pipeline stages are independently identifiable. | PASS | Separate Raw, Staging, Validation Issue, Mastering Candidate, Review Decision, Supplier Offer/Price/Packaging and Serving tables; run metrics. | Acceptance test asserts row counts and status/metrics through status endpoint. | None. |
| Retry/replay/illegal-transition behavior is safe. | PASS | Submission idempotency, stage idempotency, terminal replay handling, run claim CAS. | Acceptance test asserts flow replay does not duplicate, duplicate approval/publication reuse, terminal run claim raises `TerminalRunReplay`. | None. |
| v1 compatibility remains intact. | PASS | v1 router and legacy import path unchanged. | Covered by existing regression suite; acceptance test does not alter v1. | Continue running full suite. |

## CIS-104 Child Task Evidence

| Child | Current acceptance evidence |
|---|---|
| CIS-104.1 Ingestion Run model | `IngestionRun` creates queued/running/terminal lifecycle and is exercised by submission, Prefect and acceptance tests. |
| CIS-104.2 Raw persistence | `CatalogueRawObservation` is populated only from source-located evidence and reconstructed as `RawObservationV1`. |
| CIS-104.3 Staging representation | `CatalogueStagingItem` stores raw/proposed values separately with raw-observation lineage. |
| CIS-104.4 Contract validation | Raw, Staging, Mastering Candidate, Validation Issue and Serving contracts are reconstructed and validated by mappers/tests. |
| CIS-104.5 Validation Issue / DLQ path | Invalid `By Quote` cost creates durable blocking `STAGING_COST_BASIS_UNRESOLVED` with guidance and lineage. |
| CIS-104.6 Canonical load with lineage | Explicitly approved candidate applies to supplier offer, price and packaging with review/source/run lineage. |
| CIS-104.7 Serving representation | Approved data publishes to `CatalogueServingPublication` and reconstructs `ServingItemV1`; invalid rows are absent. |

## Lifecycle Mapping

The run lifecycle is machine-ingestion oriented:

```text
queued -> running -> completed | completed_with_warnings | failed | cancelled
```

Business review is represented on `CatalogueMasteringCandidate.review_status`.
For CIS-104 acceptance, "pending review" means the Prefect machine run is
terminal and a candidate remains `PENDING_REVIEW`; it is not a separate run
status.

The acceptance test continues from that explicit review boundary by calling the
same review/application/publication services that a later HITL API would call.

## Deferred Work

- A HITL API or UI for review and validation-issue resolution.
- Automatic Product Variant creation or matching beyond the current approved
  service boundary. The acceptance fixture uses an existing canonical SKU.
- A public v2 Serving retrieval endpoint, if product requirements later need
  HTTP retrieval rather than service-level retrieval.
- Wider supplier examples beyond the currently supported evidence-backed
  Hill's and Alfamedic runtime contracts.
